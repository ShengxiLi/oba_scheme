##How to install?
This project includes two parts: source.zip and sample.zip. 

To embed our OBA scheme into HM 14.0 software, please replace the corresponding .cpp(s) (or .h(s)) in the original ''source'' file with those in our ''source'' file. 

The sample file provides one of the configurations (non-hierarchichal case) we have used in our test, including the parameter settings in our experiment of the paper: Optimal Bit Allocation for CTU Level Rate Control in HEVC.

##Terms of use
